## Variables 

Conductivity (Need binning to determine a threshold for high vs low), Exchange capacity (Also need binning to determine threshold), Soil_NH4, Soil_CH4

## Troubleshoot to verify predicted inverse relationship between conducitivty/exchange capacity and methane/ammonium production 

1.) Correlation graph:
See if there's a negative relationship between conducitvity and NH4, and test for signficance
conductivity vs NH4 
conductivity vs CH4 
exchange capacity vs NH4 
exchange capacity vs CH4
Conductivity vs exchange

2.) Diversity metrics:
First extract taxonomic info using qiime2, then look at high vs low comparisons of conductivity and exchange capacity 

3.) Plot taxa barplot:
To see if there are certain taxa more representative or not

4.) Relative abundance
After you have filtered out cyanobacteria
Get a boxplot that tells you whether one is higher or lower 
Hopefully see bacterial relatively more abundant in high or low conditions

5.) Functional analysis 
Not taught in course but may have to research how to do it on our own 
Module 19 teaches you 
Gives u predictive functional profile on your groups
